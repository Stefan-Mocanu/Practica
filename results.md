- **Evaluation:** The steps are correctly followed, and the final MST is correct.
- **Grade:** 0.5 points.

**Exercise 7 (0.5 points):**
- **Requirement:** Determine if there is an Eulerian path in the graph and provide such a path if it exists or modify the graph to make it Eulerian.
- **Correct answer:** No Eulerian path exists, but adding 3 edges would create one.
- **Student answer:** The student correctly identifies that no Eulerian path exists and suggests the correct 3 edges to add. The Eulerian path provided is correct.
- **Evaluation:** The student's answer is correct, and the path is valid.
- **Grade:** 0.5 points.
